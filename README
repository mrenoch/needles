A collection of tools and notes I am using to begin to research automated
qualitative data analysis.

== ocr ==
These two scripts are both taken from 

http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20061210115516438

They rely on http://sourceforge.net/projects/tesseract-ocr to perform the ocr.

Tesseract reads tif files, so you must first convert pdfs to tifs, and 
then run the ocr.

== calais == 
Scripts culled from these two calais recipes, to do batch calais requests
